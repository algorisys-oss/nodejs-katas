# Node.js Katas

An interactive, kata-driven learning platform for Node.js — from runtime internals to production backend systems.

## What This Is

A structured playground that teaches Node.js as an **event-driven systems runtime**, not just "JavaScript with Express." Learners work through hands-on katas that cover:

- Runtime internals & the event loop
- Streams, buffers, and backpressure
- TCP/UDP networking & HTTP from first principles
- WebSockets & real-time systems
- PostgreSQL integration (connections, transactions, streaming queries)
- Security, observability, and production scaling

## Learning Path

| 4 | Buffers, Binary Data & Encoding |
| 5 | Streams & Backpressure |
| 6 | Networking Fundamentals |
| 7 | HTTP from First Principles |
| 7A | WebSockets & Real-Time Systems |
| 8 | Building Web Servers & APIs |
| 8A | File Uploads & Multipart Streaming |
| 9 | PostgreSQL Integration |
| 9A | Advanced PostgreSQL in Node.js |
| 10 | Cryptography & Security |
| 11 | Child Processes & Worker Threads |
| 12 | Observability & Reliability |
| 13 | Performance & Scaling |
| 14 | Background Jobs & Async Systems |
| 15 | Frameworks (After Fundamentals) |
| 16 | Advanced Architectures |
